# TowerCrane
This Github hosts the code for the Tower Crane System. While there are multiple folders in this repository, the two that matter the most are Arduino Code and Crane GUI

# Arduino Code
This holds the code that is needed to run the Arduino side of the tower crane system. This handles connecting the Odrive Motors, interpretting commands from the GUi and controller, and convolving different shapers 

# Crane GUI 

This a set of Python code dedicated to running the Crane GUI. Either run craneGUI_main.py as an executable or VS code editor.
